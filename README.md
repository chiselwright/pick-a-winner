# pick-a-winner

Given that you've sold a lot of raffle tickets, and you'd like a more visual
way to pick a winner than simply picking a ticket and mumbling someone's name
how about you put together a csv file, upload it, and watch the shiny!

## csv format

The csv format is really simple:

 * no header row
 * name,ticketspurchased

entrants.csv is an example file you can use.
